The cosmology of the universe provides the largest scale framing of many important issues of relevance to the [[meaning of life]] and the nature of [[physical reality]].

The basic facts are well established, as summarized in the [chronology of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe) wikipedia page, and despite a few dissenters, there is almost universal agreement on the basic facts regarding the occurrence of a "big bang" roughly 13.8 billion years ago.

It is notable that relative to most other scale constants in our universe, 13.8 billion is a remarkably comprehensible number. There may be roughly that number of people on the planet at some point, for example. And some people own more than that number of dollars. Thus, in some sense, the universe is still relatively young.

## Cyclic models

I personally believe that black holes will ultimately merge together to form a giant black hole that will swallow everything in the observable universe, and when it reaches a critical mass, it will explode and create a brand new big bang, starting the whole process anew, with this process continuing through an infinity of space and time. This is one example of a [cyclic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model) (wikipedia link) of cosmology, of which many forms have been developed.
