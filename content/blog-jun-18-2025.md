On the great occasion of today's supreme court decision, I am inspired to reflect on how all of my fondest wishes for this great country are just falling into line, one after the other.

I now have the greatest privilege of having Clarence Thomas and his buddies making all of the most important decisions for my family and me, relieving all of us of this terrible burden we've been carrying around for so long.

I just wish they'd all come over to my house and move right on in, making every single decision for me! What a great honor, privilege, and relief that would be!

They can just come on up into my dear daughter's room, and tell her right to her face that all those strong, clear unambiguous thoughts and feelings she has are just plain wrong! Of _course_ they know better than her who she should be! 

Those many nights when she cries herself to sleep over her lost childhood as a girl, having sleepovers with her girlfriends -- they can just whisk that all away with the kind of certainty that only God can provide: she was born a man, and a man she must therefore be!

What a great relief this will be to her, to have these amazing paragons of virtue, unsullied by any taint of questionable life choices or corruption, provide such a pristine guiding light for all of us!

And nothing could possibly make me any prouder than to have Clarence, Samuel, John, Niel and Brett gang rape my dear wife, and then force her to carry their spawn to term! I tingle with anticipation for the moment when the beloved newborn arrives, and the look on my cherished wife's face when she finally discovers who the lucky father is! What a fabulous celebration of the sanctity of life that would be!

When I wake up each day, I just couldn't be more proud to understand that our Dear Leader is at the helm, unobstructed with any concern for any possible legal complications involved in accomplishing what surely all Americans cherish most!

Of course, I'm talking about having a Royal Family, finally, after all these years lusting after the British and their enviable situation. After nearly 250 years, it is about time!

Lest any traitorous unfaithful rebels get in the way, we can all feel safer knowing that the National Guard and the Marines are patrolling our streets, keeping undesirables locked up or neutralized by any means necessary.

A clean, tidy, safe society, without any brown or black "smudges" to blemish the pristine white world we all want -- who could possibly dream of anything better!? We'll soon finish deporting all the undesirables and ensure that only the purest of the pure are allowed into this rarefied world that only the absolute _best_ people can enjoy.

I just can't possibly be happier that I was born white, and can therefore enjoy this amazing opportunity to live the rest of my life in this fantastic Disney-like utopia where everything is absolutely perfect, and I don't have to worry about a single discordant note or a single gold ornament out of place.

I've got the best and brightest making sure that every single step of my dear, precious life is looked after with the utmost care and attention.

That reminds me: where would I be without RFK Jr. making all those impossibly difficult medical decisions on my behalf! The only thing I hate more than wearing a mask is getting a shot, so I can't believe how lucky I am that I never need to worry about that again!!

Oh, and did I mention how much I miss the smell of gasoline and the warmth of summer, year-round? Yep, when I stop to reflect, I really just can't believe how every single last thing is just so much better than before! No more annoying know-it-all scientists telling me all that unwanted information that just ruins my perfect days. Just the absolute calm that can only come from complete, unadulterated _certainty_. The TRUTH! Living the dream!
