The scientific method is the primary process for developing a shared [[objective]] understanding about our physical universe. It has the following steps:

1. Come up with a general question or problem, e.g., based on an informal _observation_ about something of interest.

2. Form a specific _hypothesis_ about how that something might work, which makes testable _predictions_.

3. Collect _data_ that could actually test the predictions of the hypothesis, in comparison to other possible hypotheses. It is essential that the data be collected using a well-specified procedure that could be _replicated_ by other scientists. 

4. _Analyze_ the data to determine whether any effects observed are strong enough to be clearly distinguishable from random chance and noise.

5. _Draw conclusions_: how compelling are the data, what holes are there in the data that would allow other hypotheses to explain the observed effects, etc?

6. _Iterate!_ Plug the holes, think of other alternative explanations, test those, etc.

These steps can incrementally pull us out of our individual [[subjective]] fortresses through the critical lever of [[consistency]]. If you articulate a clear sequence of steps to perform in an experiment, and tell me exactly what you observe as results, and I do the same thing to the best of my ability, and we both get _consistent_ results, then it seems like there might be something _real_ and _objectively true_ going on. Or at least the world isn't completely random. As more and more people do the same thing, and continue to get consistent results, the odds that each one of us is just being individually tricked by some kind of subjective illusion would seem to go down.

As this scientific process continues, ever broader networks of interconnected hypotheses and associated empirical data accumulate, and if all of these remain somehow consistent with each other, it really starts to seem like there might be some kind of broader _laws_ governing the behavior of the outside world. Furthermore, all of this scientific knowledge often makes its way into new kinds of technology, which depends on those same laws, further bolstering the network of consistency across people.
