Welcome to **The Grey Space**, a world of thoughts about thoughts, the [[brains]] that make those thoughts happen, and the world outside those thoughts, also known as [[physical reality]].

Also see [poetry.grey-space.org](https://poetry.grey-space.org) for poems that provide a more artistic way of capturing many of the same ideas.

So far this is all the work of Randall C. O'Reilly, who otherwise spends his days creating biologically-based computational models of the brain: [compcogneuro.org](https://compcogneuro.org).
