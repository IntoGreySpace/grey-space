The concept of supervenience is popular in philosophical circles, and is well described in the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience). For a physically-grounded philosophical framework, it is not clear how much work it does, and it may be more bother than it is worth to even try to figure out exactly what the fuss is all about.

Basically, supervenience requires that changes at any level of [[emergence]] must have a corresponding lower-level "physical" change as well. This may be a problem for truly metaphysical, dualist kinds of theories that somehow posit a "strong" level of emergence that entirely transcends the physical, and all kinds of magical things can happen without any corresponding physical substrate. But for a physical realist, the bare [[physical reality]] is all there ever really is, and so obviously everything has to somehow be manifest in this substrate.

There is an important way in which supervenience is actually dangerous, however, which arises when people somehow assume that every property or change at a higher level of emergence has a direct _one-to-one mapping_ onto some specific aspect of the underlying physical substrate.

As is extensively discussed in [[emergence]], it specifically requires a _many-to-one mapping_ between physical substrate and a given emergent phenomenon, so the assumption of a one-to-one mapping is both inaccurate and misleading.
