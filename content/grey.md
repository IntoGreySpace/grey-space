The mantra of this **grey space** website is:

> The Grey Space is the place where ideas live. It is grey because the ultimate truths of the universe are contractory, neither black nor white but rather a beautiful grey space full of conflict and contradiction, that nevertheless admits to a perfectly self-consistent overall level of understanding. There is nothing mysterious about this grey space, and yet it holds all of the mysteries of the universe within it. This grey space lives within the grey matter of my brain, and your brain, and all other such systems capable of understanding these ideas.

This classic dialectical structure and ultimate synthesis is one specific example of such a grey space of thinking.

This **grey** page collects some of the many grey areas that arise in the various discussions here, where things are not black or white, but rather somewhere in between.

* [[Subjective]] vs. [[objective]]: Our knowledge is ultimately subjective, dependent entirely on the functioning of our own brains, which we uniquely inhabit. Nobody "else" can ever get into our own unique clump of [[physical reality]] -- we are _synonymous_ with our very own clump of matter. Nevertheless, through the [[scientific method]], we can construct a reasonably objective understanding of the physical universe that we inhabit.

* Life vs. death, stability vs change, creation vs. destruction, are all necessary for the ultimate [[meaning of life]].

* [[Process vs state]]: both are interdependent and necessary, yet process is often neglected, whereas it is often the more important of the two.
