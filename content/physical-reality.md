All of the philosophy developed herein is grounded in our scientific understanding of the the physical universe in which we exist. It is a _materialist_, _naturalist_ philosophy, with the [[scientific method]] as the ultimate arbiter of truth.

Unfortunately, despite considerable advances, a complete understanding of the nature of the physical laws of our universe remains elusive at this time. While we do have a _standard model_ that provides an accurate _description_ of the fundamental nature of physics, it is safe to say that this model is full of paradoxes and contradictions that render it essentially nonsensical according to the standard expected at every other level of scientific understanding. For example, the most widely accepted interpretations of quantum physics are either the _Copenhagen interpretation_ that essentially holds that reality does not exist until measured, or the _many worlds interpretation_ that postulates the splitting of the universe at these points of measurement. The underlying difficulties with the _measurement problem_ may well reflect a fundamentally misguided framing of the whole endeavor, given that it inevitably gives rise to such paradoxical and unsatisfying interpretations. By contrast, the much less widely embraced _de Broglie / Bohm_ _pilot wave_ framework avoids many of these issues, providing a concrete and deterministic reality at every moment, even when "observers" aren't looking.  However, it also raises other issues, the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this venue.

In any case, our goal here is to try to avoid any conclusions that depend critically on this level of understanding, while remaining consistent with the overall description provided by the standard model. There is also a corresponding [[cosmology]] that provides a reasonable big-picture understanding of the past ~13.8 billion years of existence in our universe, but it too has a number of limitations regarding our understanding of space, time and the potential future and past outside of this known window. Thus, will all appropriate caveats and context, let's proceed to the key issues at hand.

## Bare physics itself

To begin, our initial objective is to try to strip away all of our [[subjective]], abstract, cognitive-level conceptions of the world, and picture what the "bare" physical world is really like, _all by itself_, without any cognitive observers around trying to understand it. It is only by attempting this seemingly impossible feat that we can begin to understand the difference between our subjective cognitive abstractions and the "true" underlying nature of physical reality itself.

The picture I formulate in my mind is one of complete darkness, filled mostly with empty space, with some kind of buzzing blobs of energy zooming around corresponding to electrons, quarks and the whole lot. When you zoom down real close, each point in space is impossibly far from every other point, and "particles" (which act like waves) are significantly further way from each other than the planets are from the sun, if you scale the sun to the size of a proton (i.e., a hydrogen nucleus).

There are no "things" in this universe, and there is nothing but the immediate present moment of time, because constructs like "things" and the "past" require the ability to compare across space and time, which is not possible at this bare level. It is just raw stuff buzzing around endlessly, following some kind of force fields permeating this space. You cannot even measure anything at this level, because to do so would disrupt the system you are measuring. There is no distal perception like vision: everything is local in space and time.

Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, atomic and molecular elements cannot occupy the same space-time location as each other, so everything in the bare reality has its own unique spatiotemporal existence (i.e., its own _timeline_) separate from everything else. It is an exceptionally lonely and isolated place, from the usual human perspective.

Any two clumps of matter physically cannot be identical in all respects: they at least occupy a different physical spacetime location, and almost certainly have unmeasurably different states of their atomic constituents. 

**Everything in the bare physical universe is unique unto itself, a "one-off"**, simply existing autonomously in its own ever-present _now_, and _here_.

Thus, the most basic concepts of _identity_, _similarity_, _differentiation_, _categories_, and _persistence_ over time are all revealed to be constructs of the cognitive observer: they do not exist as such in the bare physical universe.

## Epistemology and all that

The major foundations of philosophical thought wrestle with the steps involved in going from this bare physical universe to the familiar world of objects and concepts that fill our subjective experience.

From a modern, neuroscientific perspective, the answers to such puzzles are to be found within the neural structures in the brain that are shaped via learning mechanisms over many experiences, to form the [[mental representations]] as distributed patterns of neural activity that we as human brains subjectively experience as thoughts in our minds. As this is the primary focus of my scientific research (i.e., the "day job"), it is not a focus here. It suffices to say that computer simulations of these mechanisms are capable of extracting statistical and predictive regularities from the sensory world to reliably form similar distributed representations across individuals with similar overall brain structures and mechanisms.

When raised in a culture with language and a foundation of scientific knowledge, our brains develop enough of a systematic basis set of concepts to understand the words in documents such as these, and so we get on with it from there.

## It is all in your head, but it is NOT arbitrary!

To this point, we have established that _everything_ above the bare physical level _is in your head_, not "out there" in the world in any manifest way.

However, just because this understanding is in your head, **it is not therefore arbitrary** or completely up to your own subjective whims to describe in any way you see fit. This is the key step that somehow people overlook (in general, there is a strong tendency to overreact when some initial ideal is invalidated: we need to learn to embrace the [[grey]]).

Some ways of understanding the physical universe have better predictive validity than others, and the process of science is all about refining our understanding to generate more precise, accurate theories about how it all works.

## Comparison, similarity, and categorization in a one-off world

Any attempt to posit that "this thing" is the "same" as some "other thing" violates the bare physical reality that everything is its own unique blob of matter. No two physical entities (composed of fermions) can _ever_ be completely identical, and the individual constituents are exceptionally unlikely to be precisely comparable in any way (measurement issues aside) as the systems get to the macroscopic sizes that we can actually perceive and directly understand. Furthermore, any more complex such combination of molecules is exceptionally unlikely to ever be identical to _itself_ at a prior moment in time, given the ever-evolving nature of the physical components and their relationships to each other.

Thus, any attempt to assert that two things are "the same" necessarily must be qualified relative to an abstract, mental category based on some kind of criteria, that _always_ involves at least some "rounding error": differences that we just ignore because they are small relative to the main dimensions of interest.

We can posit that two objects have the same mass, or size, or color, or various other such properties, but it is literally impossible for any two objects to be the same in _all_ respects, and most of these other more limited claims are only approximately true, at least due to the limitations of quantum measurements, if not due to more prosaic measurement errors.

Philosophers are prone to coming up with thought experiments involving two identical things, or two things that  are identical except in one specific aspect. The thrust of this point is to head off such arguments at the outset: they are physically impossible, and one should be skeptical of any inferences you might otherwise want to draw from them.

For example, we are often asked to envision two people with identical brains except one happens to see an inverted spectrum compared to the other. Or two otherwise identical people except one is a "zombie" who doesn't experience consciousness. These thought experiments are dead on arrival, because it is strictly impossible for any two brains to be anywhere near identical, and the entire point about the primacy and inaccessibility of the [[subjective]] perspective derives from the fact that each individual's subjective experience is isomorphically and inexorably identified with the physical brain that they "occupy", which is unique to their clump of matter.

Inevitably, most of these lines of reasoning are about [[emergence]] and we do not need to reiterate those points here.
