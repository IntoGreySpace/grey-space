All of the philosophy developed herein is grounded in our scientific understanding of the the physical universe in which we exist. It is a _materialist_, _naturalist_ philosophy, with the [[scientific method]] as the ultimate arbiter of [[objective]] understanding.

Unfortunately, despite considerable advances, a complete understanding of the nature of the physical laws of our universe remains elusive at this time. While we do have a _standard model_ that provides an accurate _description_ of the fundamental nature of physics, it is safe to say that this model is full of paradoxes and contradictions that render it essentially nonsensical according to the standard expected at every other level of science.

For example, the most widely accepted interpretations of quantum physics are either the _Copenhagen interpretation_ that essentially holds that reality does not exist until measured, or the _many worlds interpretation_ that postulates the splitting of the universe at these points of measurement. The underlying difficulties with the woefully underspecified _measurement problem_ may well reflect a fundamentally misguided framing of the whole endeavor, given the paradoxical and unsatisfying interpretations that result. By contrast, the much less widely embraced _de Broglie / Bohm_ _pilot wave_ framework avoids many of these issues, providing a concrete and deterministic reality at every moment, even when "observers" aren't looking. However, it also raises other issues that remain unresolved, the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this venue.

In any case, our goal here is to try to avoid any conclusions that depend critically on the quantum level of understanding, while remaining consistent with the overall description provided by the standard model. There is also a corresponding [[cosmology]] that provides a reasonable big-picture understanding of the past ~13.8 billion years of existence in our universe, but it too has a number of limitations regarding our understanding of space, time and the potential future and past outside of this known window. Thus, with all appropriate caveats and context, let's proceed to the key issues at hand.

## Bare physics itself

To begin, our initial objective is to try to strip away all of our [[subjective]], abstract, cognitive-level conceptions of the world, and picture what the "bare" physical world is really like, _all by itself_, without any cognitive observers around trying to understand it. It is only by attempting this seemingly impossible feat that we can begin to understand the difference between our subjective cognitive abstractions and the "true" underlying nature of physical reality itself.

The picture I formulate in my mind is one of complete darkness, filled mostly with empty space, with some kind of buzzing blobs of energy zooming around corresponding to electrons, quarks and the whole lot. When you zoom down real close, each point in space is impossibly far from every other point, and "particles" (which act like waves) are significantly further way from each other than the planets are from the sun, if you scale the sun to the size of a proton (i.e., a hydrogen nucleus).

There are no "things" in this universe, and there is nothing but the immediate present moment of time, because constructs like "things" and the "past" require the ability to compare across space and time, which is not possible at this bare level. It is just raw stuff buzzing around endlessly, following some kind of force fields permeating  space. You cannot even measure anything at this level, because to do so would disrupt the system you are measuring. There is no distal perception like vision: everything is entirely _local_ in space and time.

Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, atomic and molecular elements cannot occupy the same space-time location as each other, so everything in the bare reality has its own unique spatiotemporal existence (i.e., its own _timeline_) separate from everything else. It is an exceptionally lonely and isolated place, from the usual human perspective.

Any two clumps of matter physically cannot be identical in all respects: they at least occupy a different physical spacetime location, and almost certainly have unmeasurably different states of their atomic constituents. 

**Everything in the bare physical universe is unique unto itself, a "one-off"**, simply existing autonomously in its own ever-present _now_, and _here_.

Thus, the most basic concepts of _identity_, _similarity_, _differentiation_, _categories_, and _persistence_ over time are all revealed to be constructs of the cognitive observer: they do not exist as such in the bare physical universe.

## Epistemology and all that

The major foundations of philosophical thought wrestle with the steps involved in going from this bare physical universe to the familiar world of objects and concepts that fill our subjective experience. This requires a _stack of assumptions_ as outlined in [[epistemology]].

The short story is that, when raised in a culture with language and a foundation of scientific knowledge, our brains develop enough of a systematic basis set of concepts to understand the words in documents such as these, and so we get on with it from there.

## It is all in your head, but it is NOT arbitrary!

To this point, we have established that _everything_ above the bare physical level _is in your head_, not "out there" in the world in any manifest way.

However, just because this understanding is in your head, **it is not therefore arbitrary** or completely up to your own [[subjective]] whims to describe in any way you see fit. In general, there is a strong tendency to overreact when some initial ideal, like some kind of automatic access to the physical truth, is invalidated: we need to learn to embrace the [[grey]].

Some ways of understanding the physical universe have better predictive validity than others, and the process of science is all about refining our [[objective]] understanding to generate more precise, accurate theories about how it all works (see [[epistemology#truth-likeness]]).

This objective knowledge is "real" in the sense that it provides a good, predictive account of how reality behaves, but it is not "real" in the sense that it somehow comes directly into our brains from the physical universe. Constructs such as "electrons" and "electromagnetic force" are theoretical tools we use to describe the behavior of the physical universe: they are what they are, and we are just trying to accurately describe them using concepts in our brains.

Considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the idea that the same physical laws operate everywhere in the observable universe, and the standard model, despite its various limitations, strongly suggests that there are a finite set of such laws that can explain how it all works. Thus, it does seem that the physical universe can be understood to some level of completeness: it is not some kind of random thing with "magical" properties that have no explanation.
